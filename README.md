# Stock-Application

A dashboard to track the price of your stocks, in real-time.
This platform will display the user's list of companies with their current shares and values. 
On signing up, the user will be allocated a random number of stocks chosen from the existing stocks in the DB.
No external API has been used to fetch the data, a select number of stocks with initial values has been stored in the DB.
All computations performed for incrementing/decrementing the value of each stock has been attempted to closely imitate a real scenario.
The value of these shares change dynamically with respect to time. Socket.IO has been used to achieve real-time interaction.
